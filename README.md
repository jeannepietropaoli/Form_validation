The goal of this project is to create a simple form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields to practice form validation in JS and CSS.

## Skills to practice

- Working with HTML form element and its specific attributes
- Using the constraint validation API
- Using live CSS inline validation (pseudo-class, pseudo-elements...) to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not
- Writing regular expressions (Regex) and using it as a pattern to filter inputs
- Organize code to easily add future features (phone number etc) and their custom validation options (error messages...)

## Features

Simple form with :
- Simple visible cues (ðŸ—¸ / x) for the user to know if the field is correctly completed
- regex pattern validation for e-mail and password
- regex pattern ZIP code validation depending on the selected country
- Passwords-match checking
- Custom error messages to guide the user to correctly complete the form
- Organized code to easily add new features to the form (new countries and their ZIP code pattern, new section in the form and their error message...)

## Improvements

- Upgrade the design
- Add countries / ZIP code patterns
- Split the inputs' eventListener to break the nesting
